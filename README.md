<img src="https://github.com/ContaTP/BATS-Bayesian-Adaptive-Trial-Simulator/blob/master/example/bcts.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>


A python application for mainly conducting simulations for Bayesian Multi-Arm Multi-Stage clinical trial design. But in future, we aim to develop BATS into a quick and user-friendly trial simulator for all kinds of Bayesian clinical trial design.


The motivation of this project is the huge amount of time spent on our simulation for a Bayesian design.
